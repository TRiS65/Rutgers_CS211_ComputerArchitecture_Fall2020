In this assignment, you will improve your C programming skills by implementing graph algorithms.

First, you represent a graph data structure in C by representing undirected and weighted directed graphs. 

Second, you implement two simple graph traversal algorithms breadth- rst search (BFS) and depth- rst search (DFS). 

Third, you will use the DFS traversal to single-source shortest path  computation in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). 

Lastly, you will implement Dijkstras shortest path algorithm that is not limited to DAGs and can be used to nd single-source shortest paths in all directed graphs that have no edges with negative weights.
